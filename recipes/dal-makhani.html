    <h1><strong><em>Dal Makhani</em></strong></h1>
    <p>This Dal Makhani recipe is a restaurant style version with subtle smoky flavors and creaminess of the lentils. If you love authentic Punjabi food then you are going to love this Dal Makhani even more.</p>
    <P>Dal Makhani is one of the most popular lentil recipes from the North Indian Punjabi cuisine made with Whole Black Lentils (known as Urad dal or Kaali Dal in Hindi) and Kidney Beans (known as Rajma in Hindi).</P>
    <p>For this recipe, I have used a pressure cooker to cook the lentils, but I have explained the method of cooking the lentils in a pan or pot in the notes section of the recipe card.</p>       

    <strong><ul>Ingrediants</ul></strong>
    <li>2 cup soaked overnight red kidney beans</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
    <li>4 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 large chopped onion</li>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato puree</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
<li>    1/2 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
<li>   water as required</li>
<li>   salt as required</li>
<li>   2 inch chopped ginger</li>
<li>   1 tablespoon refined oil</li>
<li>   2 medium sliced & slit green chilli</li>
<li>   1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
<li>   1/2 cup soaked overnight urad dal</li>
<li>   1/2 teaspoon garlic paste</li>
    
<p><strong><ol>Steps to cook</ol></strong></p>
<li> <strong>Soak urad, rajma overnight & pressure cook the next day</strong></li>
        <p>To prepare this popular dish, soak sabut urad and rajma overnight in three cups of water. Drain it and pressure cook in 6 cups of water with salt as per taste. This makes the rajma and dal soft.</p>
<li><strong>Fry the onions, green chillies & tomato puree</strong></li>
    Take a kadhai on medium flame, then heat the oil and add the cumin seeds. Once the cumin seeds crackle, you can add half the ginger-garlic paste and stir for some time. Then add some onions, chopped green chillies and tomato puree. Fry until the mix turns golden. If you are someone who loves the authentic style of Dal Makhani, then we suggest you to use ghee instead of oil.
<li><strong>Add the rajma & dal</strong></li>
    Once the bhuna masala is ready you can add the pressure cooked Rajma and dal, and bring to a boil. If you want your Dal Makhani to be smooth, you can grind the masala first and then add the dal and Rajma.
<li><strong>Add the garam masala & garnish with fresh cream & coriander leaves</strong></li>
    Then add garam masala and salt as per your taste. Stir well and bring to boil, if you think that the dal is too thick, you can add some water. Then add some fresh cream to this recipe and stir well. This will make your Dal Makhani creamy and delicious. Garnish this recipe with fresh cream and freshly chopped coriander leaves.
