    <p><strong><h1><em>Sunshine Jalapeno Popppers</em></h1></strong></p>
    <p>Crispy, spicy, and cheesy jalapeño poppers are a very popular appetizer in restaurants, and our accessible recipe can bring the bite-sized treats to your table in all their glory without much trouble. It just takes some time, easy-to-find ingredients, and patience when assembling the jalapeños to make these tasty bites your new go-to appetizer when decadent and spicy food is in order.</p>
    <p>Our recipe requires a little preparation. When working with peppers like these, we recommend you use disposable gloves and avoid touching your face, as the jalapeño juices can get into your eyes or nose and cause an uncomfortable burn.</p>
    <p>After hollowing out the peppers comes the cheesy filling and deep-frying until a golden-brown color sets all around the jalapeños and they're ready for the serving plate. The irresistible crisp exterior is only complemented by a creamy warm inside. Beautiful on their own as an appetizer or snack, these jalapeños can double as a side dish for milder flavors like grilled chicken breast or carne asada. Alternatively, serve them with chips, salsa, and guacamole for a festive spread.</p>
    <p>Before you start, be sure to have at hand an oil for frying that can withstand the temperature required for deep-frying. Canola, peanut, and vegetable oils are good choices. For a non-vegetarian version, add chopped bacon into the cream cheese filling for extra flavor and crunch.</p>

    <strong><ul>Ingrediants</ul></strong>
    <li>11 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
    <li>2 cups pepper jack cheese, shredded </li>
    <li>25 jalapeño peppers, seeded and cut in half </li>
    <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
<li> 1 egg, beaten</li>
<li> 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs, or panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>3 to 4 cups vegetable oil, for deep-frying</li>
<p><strong><ol>Steps to cook</ol></strong></p>
<li> Gather the ingredients.</li>
<li> Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese, oregano, chili powder, and pepper jack cheese. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Reserve.</li>
<li> Lower the boil to a simmer, blanch the pepper halves for 2 minutes and then place in an ice water bath. Drain and dry thoroughly with paper towels.</li>
<li> Carefully spoon the cream cheese mixture into the blanched jalapeño pepper halves. Reserve.</li>
<li> In a small bowl, combine the milk and egg.</li>
<li> In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and salt. Place the breadcrumbs in another shallow bowl and set them side by side to prepare your dredging station.</li>
<li> Dip the stuffed jalapeños into the milk, and then into the seasoned flour mixture, making sure they are thoroughly coated. Repeat the process with all halves and place the coated jalapeños on wire racks to dry for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li> Dip the jalapeños in the milk mixture again and then roll them in breadcrumbs to coat. The first milk and flour coat helps the breadcrumb to stick better to the pepper. Place all jalapeños on a clean baking sheet or baking dish that can fit inside your fridge.</li>
<li> Allow the coated peppers to dry for 30 to 40 minutes in the fridge. Reserve all dredging station ingredients, placing the milk and egg mixture in the fridge as well. If after 40 minutes you notice any jalapeños to be in need of extra dredging, repeat the breading process—milk mixture and breadcrumbs.</li>
<li> Heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to 365 F in a large skillet. Deep-fry the jalapeño poppers from 2 to 4 minutes each, until golden brown and on all sides. Add more oil in between batches, as needed, and wait for it to heat up again before adding more jalapeños. Don't overcrowd the skillet.</li>
<li> Remove the jalapeños poppers and let them drain on paper towels before plating.</li>
<li> firstly, in a large bowl take 2 cup maida, 2 tbsp rava, 1 tsp sugar, ¼ tsp baking soda, 1 tsp sugar, ½ tsp salt and 2 tbsp oil. mix well.</li>
